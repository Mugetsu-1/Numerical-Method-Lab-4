Step 1: Start

Step 2: Define the matrix A (e.g., 3x3 matrix) whose eigenvalue we want to calculate.

Step 3: Define an initial guess for the eigenvector v. This is usually a random vector or a vector of ones.

Step 4: Set the number of maximum iterations maxIterations and the convergence tolerance tolerance.

Step 5: For each iteration (up to maxIterations):

    Step 5.1: Multiply the matrix A with the current eigenvector v to obtain a new vector Av.
    Step 5.2: Compute the norm (magnitude) of the new vector Av. This norm will serve as an                     approximation of the eigenvalue.
    Step 5.3: Normalize the vector Av by dividing each element by the computed norm to update the eigenvector v.

Step 6: Estimate the eigenvalue as the norm of the new vector Av.

Step 7: Check if the difference between the estimated eigenvalue from the current iteration and the previous one is smaller than the tolerance.

    If the difference is smaller than the tolerance, stop the iterations and return the estimated eigenvalue.
    Otherwise, continue to the next iteration.

Step 8: If the algorithm reaches maxIterations without satisfying the convergence criterion, stop and return the current estimated eigenvalue.

Step 9: End
