Step 1: Start.

Step 2: Input the number of equations nn and the augmented matrix — coefficients of variables and constant terms.

Step 3: For each row ii from 0 to n−1n−1:
a) Find the row with the largest absolute value in column ii (partial pivoting) and swap it with row ii if needed.
b) If the pivot element a[i][i]==0a[i][i]==0, stop and display an error message ("Singular matrix detected").

Step 4: For each row below ii (from i+1i+1 to n−1n−1):
a) Calculate the elimination factor:
factor=a[k][i] / a[i][i]


b) Update row kk:
a[k][j]=a[k][j] − factor × a[i][j] for each j from i to n−1


c) Update the constant term:
b[k]=b[k]−factor × b[i]


Step 5: After forward elimination, the matrix is now in upper triangular form.

Step 6: Perform back substitution to solve for the unknown variables:
a) Start from the last row and move upward.
b) Solve for the current variable:
x[i] =  ( b[i]−∑j=i+1 n−1 a[i][j] × x[j] ) / a[i][i]


Step 7: Repeat back substitution for all rows until x[0]x[0] is found.

Step 8: Display the solution x[n]x[1],x[2],…,x[n].

Step 9: End.
